Simple javascript form validation using the constraint validation API.

Using a polyfill such as <a href="https://hyperform.js.org/">Hyperform</a> would make it possible to compensate for lack of API support in older browsers.

For now it's pretty basic though. This was done with <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/forms-javascript?ref=lnav">the Odin Project Javascript section</a> on forms.
